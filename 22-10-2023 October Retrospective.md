# Galasa team retrospective Oct 2023

We used a mural here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMtLuwZ4=/

## Bad points/things we didn't do well/need to stop doing

- CLI cobra commands still aren't unit tested, makes for awkard development not knowing when commands are broken
- Having more stories planned prior to the iteration kickoff. Need a few planning meetings to sort out the backlog
- Struggling a bit with 3 people working together, would rather 2 or working alone
- Authentication put on hold while internal project is in flight
- Having half of the IBM team redirected onto other work üëç
- It would be good if there was a regular (monthly) blog on Galasa subjects
- Youtube videos and blog
- Give access to eamon and savvas for galasa prod
- Increase publicity
- Not enough people outside of core group contributing üëç
- Look to see how we can gain more contributors.
- Need alternative to CICSk8s to run our helm charts
- Reserve some time in the iteration for sorting out IVT tests to stop them failing.
- OMP not giving us access to an IBM cloud account
- We require OMP LPAR to run our IVTs
- Not got the ability to see or run security scans yet on LF
- There are references to Eclipse on galasa.dev web site. Can we retire eclipse support ?
- OMP taking a long time to get an IBM cloud account sorted. - Had to migrate to a different account temporarily = extra work

## Ideas

- Potentially advertise to a wider audience than mainframe people? ie universities?
- Mark new issues as "good first issue" to avoid having to go back through issues and hopefully attract new contributors?
- Labelling Github issues as "first issue" to help those that are starting out
- Will may be able to reach out ?

## Good points/things we did well/things we should continue to do

- Getting the Galasa channels on OMP
- There is activity on the Galasa slack workspace showing people using Galasa actively
- Development has not been greatly impacted despite other item taking priority
- Savvas helping Holly and Fiona out üëç
- Mike and Savvas's video that can be turned into a blog post
- Great progress adding more functionality to CLI tools
- Demo as part of the meeting to capture CPS properties
- Copyright changes all went very well
- Scrum and Iteration Meetings in the open are going well
- CLI tool commands for properties CRUD - no more manual etcdctl commands!
- Design meeting required to look at the problem of bumping release versions
- More interest in using Galasa internally - successfully answered several questions and walked users through setup (ecosystem and CLI)
- Hold retrospectives in the open over zoom
- The cluster migration has been successful
- Talks about making Galasa more recognised through blogs/videos
- Team is very flexible in changing the order of tasks during an iteration

## Actions we are going to do to sort some of those out

- It would be good if there was a regular (monthly) blog on Galasa subjects
- Youtube videos and blog
- Give access to eamon and savvas for galasa prod
- Increase publicity
- Not enough people outside of core group contributing üëç
- Look to see how we can gain more contributors.
- Need alternative to CICSk8s to run our helm charts
- Reserve some time in the iteration for sorting out IVT tests to stop them failing.
