- Next development iteration is aimed for the 28th, with timing, days, and participants to be determined. Iteration planning will be held every other week.

There's consideration of moving infrastructure into the OMP (Open Mainframe Project).
- A call is scheduled with OMP to discuss transitioning Galasa's infrastructure, with an emphasis on moving away from IBM infrastructure for better build capabilities.

- Plans to push out the Galasa Slack Workspace are underway, awaiting formal voting at the next TSC (Technical Steering Committee) meeting.
- Discussion about adding facilities within Galasa to simplify sign-on for TSO and CICS without manual coding, potentially benefiting Macro4 in creating IVPs in Galasa format, streamlining current lengthy processes.
- Use of GitHub projects as a Kan Ban board for issue tracking, open for public participation, promoting transparency in raising and addressing issues. (https://github.com/orgs/galasa-dev/projects/3/views/1)
