Developement Containers
- Push to next TSC because of lack of attendance.

OMP and IBM Cloud
- OMP have now paid for IBM Cloud resource so project can now access this.
- Plan the migration into the OMP IBM Cloud. Mike believes it'll be around a month.

Community by-laws
- Example of a charter for the TSC: https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/charter.md
- Suggestion is to draft a charter which is very basic and then email that out to everyone.
- Sub sections: Voting Members, Responsibilities etc.
- Will and Louisa to look at whether there's a blank charter as a base.

OpenSSF Best Practices Badge
- Current progress and any comments can go here: https://github.com/galasa-dev/projectmanagement/issues/1587
- Looking for volunteers

Development Team
- Development are working on providing the ability to reset a test by essentially requeueing it if it were to get stuck due to a timeout or lost connection, cancelling a running test and working on the ability to kick off a Gherkin test from the command line to run locally.
- These three things will be helping capability to remove the Eclipse Plug-In.
- Authentication can then be turned on.
- Working on Gherkin support.

AOB
- Jade's Kafka project: She is going to schedule more 1:1 conversations around the project over the next week. More stories are going to come up over the next week or two as Jade scopes out her project.
