# Galasa TSC Meeting 13th January 2025

The meeting on the 13th January 2025 did not go ahead due to the lack of progress over the Christmas and New Year break. The contributors continue to work on the issues in the link [here](https://github.com/orgs/galasa-dev/projects/3).

The next meeting is scheduled for the 11th January. The contributors continue to meet as per the calendar [here](https://lists.openmainframeproject.org/g/galasa-discussion/calendar).
