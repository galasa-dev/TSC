# Galasa TSC Meeting 11th March 2025

The meeting on the 11th March 2025 didn't go ahead due to a lack of content from the contributors. The contributors continue to work on the issues in the link [here](https://github.com/orgs/galasa-dev/projects/3).

Updates below since the last TSC:
* The contributing team are continuing to work on the backlog listed [here](https://github.com/orgs/galasa-dev/projects/3) and are working to release 0.40.0 in the next couple weeks. If youâ€™re able to contribute code, a pull request, or help on any of the issues then we welcome any contributions.
* Shout-out to Gerald for presenting on Galasa at SHARE in Washington DC last week as well, thank you.
* There is also a blog and video released from our last TSC call [here](https://openmainframeproject.org/blog/galasa-updates/) that outlines what the team have been working on and the roadmap looking forward.
* In other news, I have been going through the TSC voting members for a refresh, if anyone would like to become a voting member of the project do let me know. The current members are listed [here](https://github.com/galasa-dev/TSC/tree/main).

The next meeting is scheduled for the 8th April 2025. The contributors continue to meet as per the calendar [here](https://lists.openmainframeproject.org/g/galasa-discussion/calendar).
